This project development occured from September 2024 to November 2024. Essentially, the goal of this project was to develop an interface for serial communication using the Xilinx Blackboard. To control this interface, a linux kernel transmitted 
data to direct the serial IP which contained the verilog interface. To ensure usability, a kernel mod was developed to create a virtual file which contained the main functions of the serial interface. To model the desing, the UART protocol served
as a framework.
