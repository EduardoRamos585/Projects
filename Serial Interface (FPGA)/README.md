This project development occured from September 2024 to November 2024. Essentially, the goal of this project was to implement a programmable Serial IP module capable of being controlled and
configured from the processor subsystem over an AXI4-lite interface. To ensure usability, a kernel mod was developed to create a virtual file which contained the main functions of the serial interface. To model the desing, the UART protocol served as a framework, for which baud rates of 9600, 115200, and 256000 are supported.
