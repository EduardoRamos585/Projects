This code was developed during my Fall 2022 semester, were the objective was to construct a calculator. To accomplish this, the functionality of the calculator was divided into different modules to facilitate the
process. By the end, the calculator was able to compute addition/subtraction from -127 to 126. To detect any possible overflow, an overflow functionality was added as well.
