This folder contains the completed version of the Real Time Operating System I designed during Fall 2024. This OS puts priority on completing tasks in a controlled time frame, where each task is allocated a portion of memory and certain r/w privileges. For this project the Tiva Board C series microcontroller was a perfect choice since it provides a native memory protection untit to enforce access control over allocated tasks. Furthermore, to ensure real-time responsivness, a preemptive scheduler was included to ensure high-priority tasks aren't obstructed from performing thier functions.
